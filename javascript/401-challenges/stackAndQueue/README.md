# Challenge Summary

## Challenge 10: Singly Linked List implementation

Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue

### Stack

1. Can successfully push onto a stack
2. Can successfully push multiple values onto a stack
3. Can successfully pop off the stack
4. Can successfully empty a stack after multiple pops
5. Can successfully peek the next item on the stack
6. Can successfully instantiate an empty stack
7. Calling pop or peek on empty stack raises exception

### Queue

1. Can successfully enqueue into a queue
2. Can successfully enqueue multiple values into a queue
3. Can successfully dequeue out of a queue the expected value
4. Can successfully peek into a queue, seeing the expected value
5. Can successfully empty a queue after multiple dequeues
6. Can successfully instantiate an empty queue
