# Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a sorting algorithm that traverses an array multiple times and sorts the items one at a time until the array is sorted shortest to longest.

The first pass through determines the current number at the index of 0.

Next we compare this value to the value of the array at index 1. We shift the current number (index 0) left or right depending on whether the amount is higher or lower.

We continue comparing our current number to other numbers in the array, shifting as necessary. 

In our next pass through we compare index 1 to all numbers and shift left or right as necessary.

We repeat this process for each index position until all numbers return a sorted array.
