# Trees

## Problem Domain: Code Challenge 15

Instantiate a Binary Tree & Binary Search Tree

- Create a Binary Tree class
- Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
  - pre order
  - in order
  - post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

- Create a Binary Search Tree class
- This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
  - Add- Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
  - Contains- Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

- Write tests to prove the following functionality:
  - Can successfully instantiate an empty tree
  - Can successfully instantiate a tree with a single root node
  - Can successfully add a left child and right child to a single root node
  - Can successfully return a collection from a preorder traversal
  - Can successfully return a collection from an inorder traversal
  - Can successfully return a collection from a postorder traversal

## Problem Domain: Code Challenge 16

  - Find maximum value
